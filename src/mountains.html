              My project,"Memories", is a cinematic video, with several still
              shots, that would give off a very cinematic ambiance. The video
              tell the story of places experienced by "certain people" or minds,
              and show the mystery of forgotten memories. That's why my project
              is called "Memories", as it allows me to have a vast idea of shots
              and composition.<br />
              A large proportion of the shots is completely natural and already
              composed, but there i also be shots composed by myself or I have
              my own scenario, like a scene from a film.
