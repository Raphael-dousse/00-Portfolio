                My name is Raphaël Dousse, I am an 18-year old interactive media
                designer student at Eikon, a renowned applied arts school in
                Fribourg, Switzerland.

              <strong>
                I'm passionate about cinema, video and photography production,
                but I also have experiences in web design and graphic design.
              </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              I do a lot of post-production and I work on personal projects such
              as music videos, cinematic videos, urban photography and many
              other projects. What I really like about this job is shooting,
              because there's nothing more satisfying than freezing a picture in
              time.
